# The Odin Project


### What is The Odin Project?

> The Odin Project ( TOP ) is a **free** & **open-source** curriculum for learning **Web Development**.

### Why I chose TOP?

> I chose TOP for several reasons. The first and foremost is that it's **free**. The second reason is how it sets you up realistically for the market, using **Git & Github, Linux, Terminal, etc**. The third and final reason is that it's not **easy**, many resources out there are very less hand-on. A big part of The Odin Project is about **figuring stuff on your own**.
