### What do web developers do?

In short, Web developers build and maintain websites. They often work with Clients - those who want to bring their products, services onto the web.

Web developers are suitable for those who like to solve logical problems, build a useful product, and are interested in experiencing new technologies.

### Types of web developers

**Front-end** is what users can see on a web page such as content, images, navigation bars,... **Front-end developers** use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks to present those components effectively, providing a great user experience.

**Back-end** is the component that users cannot see on a web page. It resides on the server and it's responsible for handling requests from Clients like storing, searching for data, ... **Back-end developers** are responsible for building the machinery to handle these issues. Ruby, Python, Java are commonly used programming languages for Back-end development.

**Full-stack developers** are individuals who can work with both Front-end and Back-end.

### Tools

Some basic tools commonly used in web programming are:

- Text editor: Atom, VScode, Sublime, VIM, ...
- Command line interface (CLI)
- Git
- Google, Stack Overflow

### Motivation and Mindset

A mindset open to learning, ready to absorb new things outside one's comfort zone is essential.

The learning process involves understanding the theory and applying it in practice. This will help you understand more deeply how they work. Completing projects is a way to ensure you have understood the theory and can apply it in practice.

When stuck, you can solve it by googling (usually most of the problems you encounter have been faced and solved by someone else), taking breaks (this helps you 'reset' your mind and helps your brain tackle the problem from a different perspective), or you can ask someone with experience like teachers, friends, or someone on a forum, ...

### Pitfalls to Avoid

Some things to avoid and methods to solve them are:
- Procrastination => Use the **Pomodoro** method
- Not taking breaks: Taking breaks is an important part of the learning process, it helps you reinforce the knowledge you have learned, regain energy, and the ability to absorb new knowledge,... => Set break times with Pomodoro, during relaxation time, you can listen to music, take a walk, play a quick game, or do some household chores,..
- Getting distracted by notifications from phones, computers such as messages, social media notifications, noise from TV, traffic,... => Turn off notifications during study time. Find a suitable place to focus on studying.
- Getting distracted by other unrelated or useful courses and resources during the learning process => Clearly define the learning path, the knowledge needed, and limit the time to stay away from 'rabbit holes'.
- Comparing yourself to others => Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses so comparing is misleading. Instead of comparing with others, compare with yourself in the past to see how you have progressed after 1 week, 1 month, or 1 year.

> You can learn the "Learning how to learn" course on Coursera to find a learning method suitable for you. Also, you should practice "touch typing" to get the best efficiency!

### Become a web developer
 > To become a Full-stack developer, besides knowledge from the two basic parts of Front-end and Back-end, you need additional knowledge about database (such as SQL, noSQL, cache,...); version control system (such as github, gitlab,... ); using command line, deployment (to servers like AWS, Azure,...); testing, bug fixing, security,...
